I think personal websites can serve as a fantastic source of discovery, particularly when they link to other websites also linking elsewhere. So here is my list of links, mostly of things that I already tend to recommend to friends often.

## Blogs/Personal Websites

[near.blog](https://near.blog/): A huge inspiration for making this website. Has his own [links page](https://near.blog/links/) full of incredibly high quality blog posts. Some of my favorite posts:
- [personality basins](https://near.blog/personality-basins/)
- [take more flights](https://near.blog/take-more-flights/)
- [supplements](https://near.blog/supplements/)
- [try a thing some time](https://near.blog/try-a-thing-some-time/)
- [where are the builders](https://near.blog/where-are-the-builders/)

[Nadia Asparouhova](https://nadia.xyz/): Also inspiration for this website. Worth the link if only for her [post on the jhanas](https://nadia.xyz/jhanas)

[LudwigAbap](https://ludwigabap.com/writings): Great jumping off point for programming related reading. [This post](https://ludwigabap.com/posts/on-becoming-competitive-when-joining-a-new-company/) on becoming competitive when joining a new company may prove useful for your career

[RegisterSpill](https://registerspill.thorstenball.com/): Thorsten Ball posts a weekly "Joy & Curiousity", containing interesting and joyful things from the previous week. Feels like the gems you might find by sifting through tech twitter and Hacker News but without the sifting

[Benthams Bulldog](https://benthams.substack.com/): Blog on "utilitarianism, ethical veganism, culture war stuff, philosophy, morality, and more!". Some that I think you should read:
- [The Best Thing You Can Do](https://benthams.substack.com/p/a-life-that-cannot-be-a-failure)
- [The Possibility of an Ongoing Moral Catastrophe](https://benthams.substack.com/p/the-possibility-of-an-ongoing-moral)
- [Be A Marginal Reducetarian](https://benthams.substack.com/p/be-a-marginal-reducetarian)
- [The Objections to Veganism Are All Wrong](https://benthams.substack.com/p/the-objections-to-veganism-are-all)

Some standalone posts:
- [A general case for veganism](https://morallawwithin.substack.com/p/a-general-case-for-veganism)
- [95%-ile isn't that good](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/)

## Tools

Tools I use and highly recommend, primarily for software development:
- [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/): very tastefully made modal editor (like vim) with a selection-first model (selection -> action rather than vim's action -> selection). Supports multiple cursors, has fantastic defaults (other than the theme), has LSP support out of the box, and has a plugin system coming soon.
- [opencode](https://opencode.ai/): open source AI coding agent like Claude Code/Codex. Highly configurable and built with a client-server architecture that let's them develop a TUI, desktop app, and web app simultaneously. It's being improved at an unreal pace and I think it has a very bright future.
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/): The best all around terminal.
- [Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/): A reimagined shell. Much nicer to use than bash and doesn't require much configuration. Also check out [fish](https://fishshell.com/) if you want something a little closer to bash.
- [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri): A scrollable-tiling Wayland compositor. I use this along with [Noctalia](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia-shell) as my desktop shell (much nicer than whatever I would cobble together myself). The scrollable window management hasn't been life changing (most of the time I just use one fullscreen window per workspace) but for me it is strictly better than simple tiling. I generally don't want multiple windows crammed into view at once (although niri can do that!), I would rather just have a more flexible way of managing my fullscreen windows. It also has very nice trackpad gestures if you're into that.
- [Home Row Mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods): Lifechanger. Shift, alt, ctrl, and super all accessible without leaving home row. No more twisting your hand into strange shapes when attempting to combine multiple modifiers. I think this is best done at the keyboard firmware level with something like [QMK](https://qmk.fm/), although it is possible at the software level.
